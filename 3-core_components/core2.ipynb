    "This demonstrates the tool registration pattern using Python decorators, a common technique in RPC frameworks. The **\"@mcp.tool\"** decorator transforms a regular Python function into a remotely callable endpoint while preserving its native type signatures and docstrings. What makes this distinctive is how it bridges the gap between local function execution and remote procedure calls without requiring explicit API definitions."

    "The pattern works by leveraging **Python's decorator system to create a declarative interface. When you apply @mcp.tool to a function, the framework automatically extracts metadata like parameter types, return types, and documentation to generate a complete API schema. This separation of concerns means your implementation stays clean-focused purely on business logic-while the framework handles transport, serialization, and discovery automatically.**"

    "This approach matters because it dramatically reduces boilerplate in RPC development. Instead of manually defining routes, validating inputs, and serializing outputs, you write normal Python functions and let the framework handle the RPC layer. It's particularly **valuable for AI integrations where you need to expose backend logic to language models or other services, as it maintains type safety while eliminating transport-specific code.** The tradeoff is framework dependency, but the productivity gain for API-heavy applications typically outweighs this cost."
